- Create an array of at least 10 objects with a word and its definition
- Create a function that will loop through the array of random object and store it in useState
- Use useEffect to make API call on page load and a subscription to Firebase
    - In onValue, update useState that was created to store each user-score object
- Use state as a placeholder for rel_hom parameter so whatever is stored in state after we have looped through the array will replace the placeholder
- The word + definition we get back after the API call will be stored in another state
- Store the object of word-definition that we get from the API call and another object of word-definition from the array we manually put in an another array 
- Loop through the new array to randomly choose an object (word-definition)
- Store whatever we get in state 
- Print whatever is stored in state on the page
- Create function to pass to onClick which will have a conditional statement to determine if definition matches the word
- Create another state to keep track of score 
- Inside the onClick function, update state if the word-definition match
- Print a message for user to let them know if the scored or not
- Have a progress bar that will get updated after each question
- Once all 10 questions are answered, use CSS animation to alert the user that they have finished
- Create a database to store user name and score
- Create a form for user to input their name, store user input and score in state
- Create function to pass to onSubmit, which will push data to firebase
- Get that data (user name and score) back from firebase and print on the page (scoreboard)

ERROR HANDLING
- For API error handling, use a conditional statement to check status of API, if status is not 200, render an error message
- For Firebase, add 'required' property for input element
